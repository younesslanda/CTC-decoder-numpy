# CTC-decoder-numpy

The implementation of the CTC algorithm using Numpy in Python using dynamic programming.

This code is an implementation of the CTC decoder from the paper `Connectionist Temporal Classification: Labelling Unsegmented
Sequence Data with Recurrent Neural Networks` [link](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/icml_2006.pdf)
